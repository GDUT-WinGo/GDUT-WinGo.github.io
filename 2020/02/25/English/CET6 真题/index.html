But poor diet and physical inactivity also each increase the risk of heart disease and have a role to play in the development of some cancers. Perhaps worse, the detrimental effects of an unhealthy diet and insufficient exercise are not limited to your body. Recent research has also shown that indulging in a high-fat and high-sugar diet may have negative effects on your brain, causing learning and memory deficits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>chronic disease 慢性病 health indicator 健康指标 cholesterol 胆固醇 physical inactivity 缺乏运动  detrimental effect 有害影响 insufficient exercise 缺乏运动  indulge in 沉溺于 memory deficit 记忆衰退</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Studies have found obesity is associated with impairments in cognitive functioning, as assessed by a range of learning and memory tests, such as the ability to remember a list of words presented some minutes or hours earlier. There is also <u>a growing body of evidence</u> that diet — induced cognitive impairments can emerge repidly — within weeks or even days. For example, one study found healthy adults assigned to a high-fat diet for five days showed impaired attention, memory, and mood compared with a low-fat diet control group. Another study also found eating a high-fat and high-sugar breakfast each day for as little as four days resulted in problems with learning and memorry similar to those observed in overweight and obese individuals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>obesity 肥胖 impairment 损害 cognitive functioning 认知功能 a growing body of… 越来越多的… assign to 指定到 impaired attention 注意力受损 as little as 少至 obses individuals 肥胖个体</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Body weight was not hugely different between the groups eating a healthy diet and those on high and sugar diets. So this shows negative consequences of poor dietary intake can occur even when body weight has not changed conspicuously. Thus, body weight is not always the best indicator of health and a thin person still needs to eat well and exercise regularly.</p>

<h6 id="Increased-Screen-Time-and-Wellbeing-Decline-in-Youth"><a href="#Increased-Screen-Time-and-Wellbeing-Decline-in-Youth" class="headerlink" title="Increased Screen Time and Wellbeing Decline in Youth"></a>Increased Screen Time and Wellbeing Decline in Youth</h6><p>Have young people never had it so good? Or do they face more challenges than any previous generation? Our current era in the West is one of high wealth. This means minors enjoy material benefits and legal protections that would have been the envy of those living in the past. But There is an increasing suspicion that all is not well for our youth. And one of the most popular explanations, among some experts and the popular media, is that excessive “screen time” is to blame. (This refers to all the attention young people devote to their phones, tablets and laptops. )However, this is a contentious theory and such claims have been treated skeptically by some scholars based on their reading of the relevant data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>era 时代 minor 未成年人 the envy of 令人嫉妒 / 羡慕的人 / 事物 excessive 过度的 tablet PC = laptop  computer 笔记本电脑 contentious theory 有争议的理论 skeptically 怀疑地</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now a new study has provided another contribution to the debate, uncovering strong evidence that adolescent wellbeing in the United States really is experiencing a decline and arguing that the most likely cause is the electronic riches we have given them. The background to this is that from the 1960s into the early 2000s measures of average wellbeing went up in the US. This was especially true for younger people. It reflected the fact that these decades saw a climb in general standards of living and avoidance of mass societal traumas like full-scale war or economic deprivation. However, the “screen time” hypothesis, advanced by researchers such as Jean Twenge, is that electronic devices and excessive time spent online may have reversed these trends in recent years causing problems for young peoples psychological health.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>debate 争论 mass societal traumas 大规模地社会创伤 economic deprivation 经济剥夺 hypothesis 假设 advanced by researchers 被研究人员推进</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To investigate, Twenge and her colleagues dived into the “Monitoring the Future” dataset based on annual surveys of American school students from grades 8, 10, and 12 that started in 1991. In total, 1.1 million young people answered various questions related to their wellbeing. Twenge’s teams analysis of the answers confirmed the earlier, well-established wellbeing climb, with scores rising across the 1990s, and into the later 2000s. This was found across measures like self-esteem, life satisfaction, happiness and satisfaction with individual domains like job, neighborhood or friends. But around 2012 these measures started to decline. This continued through 2016, the most recent year for which data is available.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>well-established 为大家接受的 self-esteem 自尊 individual domain个别领域</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twenge and her colleagues wanted to understand why this change in average wellbeing occurred. However, it is very hard to demonstrate causes using non-experimental data such as this. In fact, when Twenge previously used this data to suggest a screen time effect, some commentators were quick to raise this problem. They argued that her causal-sounding claims rested on correlational data, and that she had not adequately accounted for other potential causal factors. This time around, twenge and her team make a point of saying that they are not trying to establish causes as such, but that they are assessing the plausibility of potential causes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>causal-sounding 因果关系 account for sth 解释…的原因 plausibility 貌似可信</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, they explain that if a given variable is playing a role in affecting wellbeing, then we should expect<br>any change in that variable to correlate with the observed changes in wellbeing. If not, it is not plausible that the variable is a causal factor. So the researchers looked at time spent in a number of activities that could plausibly be driving the wellbeing decline. Less sport, and fewer meetings with peers correlated with lower wellbeing, as did less time reading print media (newspapers) and, surprisingly, less time doing homework. (This last finding would appear to contradict another popular hypothesis that it is our burdening of students with assignment that is causing all the problems. ) In addition, more tv watching and more electronic communication both correlated with lower wellbeing. All these effects held true for measures of happiness, life satisfaction and self-esteem, with the effects stronger in the 8th and 10th-graders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>held true for… 对…也一样成立</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, Twenge’s team dug a little deeper into the data on screen time. They found that adolescents who<br>spent a very small amount of time on digital devices — couple of hours a week — had the highest wellbeing. Their wellbeing was even higher than those who never used such devices. However, higher doses of screen time were clearly associated with lower happiness. Those spending 10-19 hours per week on their devices were 4 percent more likely to be unhappy than lower-frequency users. Those who used such devices 40 hours a week or more (one in ten teenagers) were twice as likely to be unhappy. The data was slightly complicated by the fact that there was a tendency for kids who were social in the real world to also use more online communication, but by bracketing out different cases it became clear that the real-world sociality component correlated with greater wellbeing, whereas greater time on screens or online only correlated with poorer wellbeing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>doses of …的剂量 bracket out 摆脱</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far, so plausible. But the next question is, are the drops in average wellbeing happening at the same<br>time as trends toward increased electronic device usage? It looks like it — after all, 2012 was the tipping point when more than half of Americans began owning smartphones. Twenge and her colleagues also found that across the key years of 2013-16, wellbeing was indeed lowest in years where adolescents spent more time online, on social media, and reading news online, and when more youth in the United States had smartphones. And in a second analysis, they found that where technology went, dips in wellbeing followed. For instance, years with a larger increase in online usage were followed by years with lower wellbeing, rather than the other way around. This does not prove causality, but is consistent with it. Meanwhile, TV use did not show this tracking. TV might make you less happy, but this is not what seems to be driving the recent declines in young people s average happiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>rather than the other way around 而不是相反的 causality 因果关系 be consistent with 符合</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A similar but reversed pattern was found for the activities associated with greater wellbeing. For example, years when people spent more time with friends were better years for wellbeing (and followed by better years). Sadly, the data also showed face-to-face socializing and sports activity had declined over the period covered by the survey.</p>
<p>There is another explanation that Twenge and her colleagues wanted to address: the impact of the great<br>recession of 2007-2009, which hit a great number of American families and might be affecting adolescents. The dataset they used did not include economic data, so instead the researchers looked at whether the 2013-16 wellbeing decline was tracking economic indicators. They found some evidence that some crude measures, like income inequality, correlated with changes in wellbeing. but economic measures with a more direct impact like family income and unemployment rates (which put families into difficulties), had no relationship with wellbeing. The researchers also note the recession hit some years before we see the beginning of the wellbeing drop, and before the steepest wellbeing decline, which occurred in 2013.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the great recession 大衰退 crude 粗糙的 cruel 残酷的 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The researchers conclude that electronic communication was the only adolescent activity that increased at<br>the same time psychological wellbeing declined. I suspect that some experts in the field will be keen to address alternative explanations, such as unassessed variables playing a role in the wellbeing decline. but the new work does go further than previous research and suggests that screen time should still be considered a potential barrier to young people’s flourishing.</p>

<h6 id="Passage-One"><a href="#Passage-One" class="headerlink" title="Passage One"></a>Passage One</h6><p>The dangerous thing about lying is people don’t understand how the act changes us, says Dan Ariely<br>behavioural psychologist at Duke University. Psychologists have documented children lying as early as the age of two. Some experts even consider lying a developmental milestone, like crawling and walking. because it requires sophisticated planning, attention and the ability to see a situation from someone else’s perspective to manipulate them. But, for most people, lying gets limited as we develop a sense of morality and the ability to self-regulate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>behavioural psychologist 行为心理学家 sophisticated planning 复杂的规划 manipulate 操作</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harvard cognitive neuroscientist Joshua Greene says. for most of us, lying takes work. In studies, he gave<br>subjects a chance to deceive for monetary gain while examining their brains in a functional MRI machine, which maps blood flow to active parts of the brain. Some people told the truth instantly and instinctively. But others opted to lie, and they showed increased activity in their frontal parietal control network, which is<br>involved in difficult or complex thinking. This suggests that they were deciding between truth and dishonesty and ultimately opting for the latter. For a follow-up analysis, he found that people whose neural reward centres were more active when they won money were also more likely to be among the group of liars — suggesting that lying may have to do with the inability to resist temptation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cognitive neuroscientist 认知神经学家 deceive for monetary gain 骗取金钱收益 subject 受试者 instinctively 本能地 ultimately 最后 the inability to resist temptation 无法抗拒诱惑</p>
</blockquote>
<p>External conditions also matter in terms of when and how often we lie. We are more likely to lie, research<br>shows, when we are able to rationalise it, when we are stressed and fatigued or see others being dishonest and we are less likely to lie when we have moral reminders or when we think others are watching. We as a society need to understand that, when we don’t punish lying we increase the probability it will happen again, Ariely says.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in terms of 在…方面 fatigued 疲乏的 rationalise 使合理化</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a 2016 study published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, Ariely and colleagues showed how dishonesty alters peoples brains, making it easier to tell lies in the future. When people uttered a falsehood, the scientists noticed a burst of activity in their amygdala. The amygdala is a crucial part of the brain that produces fear, anxiety and emotional responses including that sinking, guilty feeling you get when you lie. But when scientists had their subjects play a game — in which they won money by deceiving their partner, they noticed the negative signals from the amygdala began to decrease. not only that, but when people faced no consequences for dishonesty their falsehoods tended to get even more sensational. This means that if you give people multiple opportunities to lie for their own benefit, they start with little lies which get bigger over time.</p>

<h6 id="Passage-Two"><a href="#Passage-Two" class="headerlink" title="Passage Two"></a>Passage Two</h6><p>Here’s how the pacific northwest is preparing for “The big one”. It’s the mother of all disaster drills for what could be the worst disaster in American history. California has spent years preparing for “The big one” — the inevitable earthquake that will undoubtedly unleash all kinds of havoc along the famous San Andreas fault. But what if the fault that runs along the pacific northwest delivers a gigantic earthquake of its own? If the people of the Cascadia region have anything to do with it, they wont be caught unawares.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s the mother of disaster drills 灾难演习的源头 unleash all kinds of havoc<br>释放各种破坏 fault 断层 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The region is engaged in a multi-day earthquake-and-tsunami drill involving around 20,000 people. The Cascadia Rising drill gives area residents and emergency responders a chance to practice what to do in case of a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami along one of the nations dangerous — and underestimated — faults.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>be engaged in 从事 进行 tsunami 海啸 emergency responders 应急人员 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Cascadia Earthquake Zone is big enough to compete with San Andreas ( it’s been called the most<br>dangerous fault in America), but it’s much lesser known than its California cousin. Nearly 700 miles long the earthquake zone is located by the North American Plate off the coast of Pacific British Columbia, Washington Oregon and Northern California.</p>
<p>Cascadia is what’s known as a “megathrust” fault. Megathrusts are created in earthquake zones — land plate boundaries where two plates converge. In the areas where one plate is beneath another, stress builds up over time. During a megathrust event, all of that stress releases and some of the worlds most powerful earthquakes occur. Remember the 9. 1 earthquake and tsunami in the Indian Ocean off Sumatra in 2004? It was caused by a megathrust event as the India plate moved beneath the Burma micro-plate.</p>
<p>The last time a major earthquake occurred along the Cascadia fault was in 1700, so officials worry that<br>another event could occur any time. To prevent that event from becoming a catastrophe, first responders will join members of the public in rehearsals that involve communication, evacuation, search and rescue, and other scenarios.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>first responders 急救人员 rehearsal 练习 evacuation 疏散</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thousands of casualties are expected if a 9.0 carthquake were to occur. First the earthquake would shake<br>metropolitan areas including Seattle and Portland. This could trigger a tsunami that would create havoc along the coast. Not all casualties can necessarily be prevented — but by coordinating across local, state, and even national borders, officials hope that the worst-case scenario can be averted. On the exercises website officials explain that the report they prepare during this rehearsal will inform disaster management for years to come.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>casualty 伤亡人员 trigger 触发 averted 避免</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For hundreds of thousands of cascadia residents, “The big one” isn’t a question of if, only when. and it’s<br>never too early to get ready for the inevitable.</p>
<h5 id="12-二"><a href="#12-二" class="headerlink" title="12 (二)"></a>12 (二)</h5><p>The persistent haze over many of our cities is a reminder of the polluted air that we breathe, Over 80% of the world’s urban population is breathing air that fails to meet World Health Organisation guidelines, and an estimated 4.5 million people died prematurely  from outdoor air pollution in 2015.</p>
<p>Globally, urban populations are expected to double in the next 40 years, and an extra 2 billion people will need new places to live, as well as services and ways to move around their cities. What is more important, the decisions that we make now about the design of our cities will determian the everyday lives and health of the coming gerations. So what would a smug-free, or at least low-pollution, city be like?</p>
<p>Traffic has become synonymous with air pollution, and many countries intend to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars in the next two decades. But simply switching to electric can will not mean pollution-free cities. The level of emissions they cause will depend on how the electricity to run them is generated, while brakes, tyres and toads all create tiny airborne particles as they wear out.</p>
<p>Across the developed world, car use is in decline as more people move to city centers, while young people especially are opting for other means of travel. Researchers are already asking if motor vehicle use has reached its<br>peak and will decline, but transport planners have yet to catch up with this trend, instead of laying new roads to tackle traffic jams. As users of London’s orbital M25 motorway will know, new roads rapidly fill with more traffic. In the US, studies have shown that doubling the size of a road can simply double the traffic, taking us back to the starting poin.</p>

<h6 id="How-Much-Protein-Do-You-Really-Need"><a href="#How-Much-Protein-Do-You-Really-Need" class="headerlink" title="How Much Protein Do You Really Need?"></a>How Much Protein Do You Really Need?</h6><p>The marketing is tempting: Get stronger muscles and healthier bodies with minimal effort by adding protein powder to your morning shake or juice drink. Or grab a protein bar at lunch or for a quick snack. Today you can find protein supplements everywhere — online or at the pharmacy, grocery store or health food store. They come in powders, pills and bars. With more than $12 billion in sales this year, the industry is booming and according to the market research company, Grand View Research, is on track to sell billions more by 2025. But do we really need all this supplemental protein? It depends. There are pros, cons and some other things to consider.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the marketing is tempting 营销很诱人 protein powder 蛋白粉 pharmacy 药房 pros and cons 利与弊</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For starters, protein is critical for every cell in our body. It helps build nails, hair, bones and muscles. It<br>can also help you feel fuller longer than eating foods without protein. And, unlike nutrients that are found only in few foods, protein is present in all foods. The typical American diet is a lot higher in protein than a lot of us think, says registered dietitian Angela Pipitone. It’s in foods many of us expect, such as beef, chicken and other types of meat and dairy. But it’s also in foods that may not come immediately to mind like vegetables, fruit, beans and grains.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. government’s recommended daily allowance (RDA) for the average adult is 50 to 60 gram of protein a day. This may sound like a lot, but Pipitone says: “We get bits of protein here and there and that really adds up throughout the day.” Take, for example, breakfast If you eat two eggs topped with a little bit of cheese and an orange on the side, you already have 22 grams of protein. Each egg gives you 7 grams, the cheese gives you about 6 grams and the orange — about 2 grams. Add a lunch of chicken, rice and broccoli, and you are already over the recommended 50 grams. ”You can get enough protein and meet the RDA before you even get to dinner,“ says Pipitone.</p>
<p>So if it’s so easy to get your protein in food, why add more in the form of powders, snack bars or a boost at your local juice bar? No need to, says Pipitone, because, in fact, most of us already get enough protein in our diet. “Whole foods are always the best option rather than adding supplements,” she says, noting the FDA does not regulate supplements as rigorously as foods or drugs. So there could be less protein, more sugar and some additives you wouldn’ t expect, such as caffeine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>regulate 控制 调控 有系统管理的 rigorously 严厉地 残酷地 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are considering a supplement, read the list of ingredients, she says, although this is not always reliable. “I’ve seen very expensive protein supplements that claim to be high quality but they might not really be beneficial for the average healthy adult,” she says. “It could just be a waste of money.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ingredient 组成部分 配料 do warrant 可以 允许 marathon 马拉松 moderately 适度地 有节制地 edge 优势</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there are certain situations that do warrant extra protein. “Anytime you’re repairing or building muscle.” Pipitone says, “such as if you’re an extreme endurance athlete training for a marathon or you’re a body builder. If you are moderately exercising for 150 minutes a week, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends, or less than that, you’ re probably not an extreme athlete. Extreme athletes expend lots of energy breaking down and repairing and building muscles. Protein can give them the edge they need to speed that process.</p>
<p>Vegans can benefit from protein supplements since they do not eat animal-based protein sources like meat, dairy or eggs. And, for someone always on-the-go who may not have time for a meal, a protein snack bar can be a good option for occasional meal replacement. Also, individuals recovering from surgery or an injury can also benefit from extra protein. So, too, can older people. At around age 60, “muscles really start to break down,” says Kathryn Starr, an aging researcher, “and because of that, the protein needs of an older adult actually Increase.”</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>In fact, along with her colleague Connie Bales. Starr recently conducted a small study that found that adding extra protein foods to the diet of obese older individuals who were trying to lose weight strengthened their muscles. Participants in the study were separated into two groups — one group was asked to eat 30 grams of protein per meal in the form of whole foods. That meant they were eating 90 grams of protein a day. The other group — the control group — was put on a typical low-calorie diet with about 50 to 60 grams of protein a day. after six months, researchers found the high protein group had significantly improved their muscle function — almost twice as much as the control group. “They were able to walk faster, had improved balance, and were also able to get up out of a chair faster than the control group.” Starr says. All 67 participants were over 60 years of age, and both groups lost about the same amount of weight.</p>
<p>Starr is now looking into whether high-protein diets also improve the quality of the muscle itself in seniors. She’s using CT scans to measure muscle size and fat, and comparing seniors on a high-protein diet with those on regular diets. She says her findings should be available in a couple of months.</p>
<p>In the meantime, 70-year-old Corliss Keith, who was in the high protein group in Starr’s latest study, say the feels a big difference. “I feel excellent,” she says. “I feel like i have a different body. I have more energy stronger.” She says she is able to take Zumba exercise classes three times a week, work out on the treadmill and take long, brisk walks. Keith also lost more than 15 pounds. “Im a fashionable person, so now I’m back in my 3-inch heels,” she says</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>As people age, Starr says muscle strength is key to helping them stay strong and continue living on their own in their own home. “I feel very much alive now,” says Keith. “I feel like I could stay by myself until I’m 100.”</p>
<p>Bat can people overdo protein? Pipitone says you do have to be careful. Other researchers say too much protein can cause cramps, headaches, and fatigue. Dehydration risk is also a risk when you eat too much protein. Pipitone says if you increase protein, you also have to increase your fluid intake. I always tell people to make sure they‘re drinking enough fluids, which for the average person is 60 to 70 ounces a day, which translates into eight 8-ounce glasses of water or liquid per day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cramp 肌肉抽搐 fatigue 疲劳 dehydration 脱水 kidney 肾脏</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There have been some indications that extra protein makes the kidneys work harder, which could be problematic for individuals with a history of kidney disease and for them the supplements may increase the risk of kidney stones, the says.</p>
<p>Bottom line, if you think you need more protein in your diet, consider these questions: Are you anextreme athlete; are you recovering from injury or surgery; or are you 60 years or older? If so, adding high protein foods like eggs and meat products to your diet can be beneficial. And, if you’re not sure, in is always a good idea to check with your primary care provider.</p>

<h6 id="Passage-One-1"><a href="#Passage-One-1" class="headerlink" title="Passage One"></a>Passage One</h6><p>Last year, a child was born at a hospital in the uk with her heart outside her body. Few babies survive this rare condition,and those who do must endure numerous operations and are likely to have complex needs. When her mother was interviewed, three weeks after her daughter’s birth, she was asked if she was prepared for what might be a daunting task caring for her. She answered without hesitation that, as far as she was concerned, this would be a “privilege”.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Rarely has there been a better example of the power of attitude, one of our most powerful psychological tools. Our attitudes allow us to turn mistakes into opportunities, and loss into the chance for new beginnings. An attitude is a settled way of thinking, feeling and/or behaving towards particular objects, people, events or ideologies. We use our attitudes to filter, interpret and react to the world around us. You weren’t born with attitudes; rather they are all learned, and this happens in a number of ways.</p>
<p>The most powerful influences occur during early childhood and include both what happened to you directly and what those around you did and said in your presence. As you acquire a distinctive identity your attitudes are further refined by the behavior of those with whom you identify — your family, those of your gender and culture and the people you admire, even though you may not know them personally. Friendships and other important relationships become increasingly important, particularly during adolescense, About that same time and throughout adulthood, the information you receive, especially when ideas are repeated in association with goals and achievements you find attractive, also refines your attitudes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>acquire a distinctive identity 获得独特的身份 refined 完善</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many people assume that our attitudes are internally consistent, that is, the way you think and feel about someone or something predicts your behavior towards them. However, may studies have found that feelings and thoughts don’t necessarily predict behavior. In general, your attitudes will be internally consistent only when th behavior is easy, and when those around you hold similar beliefs. That’s why, for example, many say they believe in the benefits of recycling or exercise, but don’t behave in line with their views, because it takes awareness, effort and courage to go beyond merely stating that you believe something is a good idea.</p>
<p>One of the most effective ways to change an attitude is to start behaving as if you already feel and think the way you’d prefer to. Take some time to reflect on your attitudes, to think about what you believe and why. Is there anything you consider a burden rather than a privilege? It so, start behaving right now as if the latter is the case.</p>

<h6 id="Passage-Two-1"><a href="#Passage-Two-1" class="headerlink" title="Passage Two"></a>Passage Two</h6><p>Industrial fishing for krill in the unspoilt waters around Antarctica is threatening the future of one of the worlds last great wildernesses, according to a new report.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the unspoilt waters 未受污染的水域 vessel 容器 in the immediate vicinity of 在…附近  penguin 企鹅 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The study by Greenpeace analysed the movements of krill fishing vessels in the region and found they were increasingly operating “in the immediate vicinity of penguin colonies and whale feeding grounds.” It also highlights incidents of fishing boats being involved in groundings, oil spills and accidents, which posed a serious threat to the Antarctic ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>oil spills 漏油 Antarctic 南极 sanctuary 保护区 tract 土地 地带 reserve 保护区 保留 存储 marine 海的</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The report, published on Tuesday, comes amid growing concern about the impact of fishing and climate change on the Antarctic. a global campaign has been launched to create a network of ocean sanctuaries to protect the seas in the region and Greenpeace is calling for an immediate halt to fishing in areas being considered for sanctuary status.</p>
<p>Frida Bengtsson from Greenpeace’s Protect the Antarctic campaign said: “If the krill industry wants to show it’s a responsible player, then it should be voluntarily getting out of any area which is being proposed as an ocean sanctuary, and should instead be backing the protection of these huge tracts of the Antarctic.”</p>
<p>A global campaign has been launched to turn a huge tract of Antarctic seas into ocean sanctuaries, protecting wildlife and banning not just krill fishing, but all fishing. One was created in the ross sea in 2016, another reserve is being proposed in a vast area of the Weddell Sea, and a third sanctuary is under consideration in the area west of the Antarctic Peninsula — a key krill fishing area.</p>
<p>The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) manages the seas around Antarctica. It will decide on the Weddell Sea sanctuary proposal at a conference in Australia in October, although a decision on the peninsula sanctuary is not expected until later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>peninsula 半岛 thrive 繁荣的</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keith Reid, a science manager at CCAMLR, said that the organisation sought “a balance between protection, conservation and sustainable fishing in the Southern Ocean.” He said although more fishing was taking placenearer penguin colonies it was often happening later in the season when these colonies were empty.</p>
<p>The creation of a system of marine protected areas is a key part of ongoing scientific and policy discussions in CCAMLR, he added. “ Our long-term operation in the region depends on a healthy and thriving antarctic marine ecosystem, which is why we have always had an open dialogue with the environmental non-governmental organisations. We strongly intend to continue this dialogue, including talks with Greenpeace, to discuss improvements based on the latest scientific data. We are not the ones to decide on the establishment of marine protected areas, but we hope to contribute positively with our knowledge and experience.”</p>
<h5 id="12（三）"><a href="#12（三）" class="headerlink" title="12（三）"></a>12（三）</h5><p>The number of devices you can talk to is multiplying — first it was your phone, then your cat, and now you can tell your kitchen appliances what to do. But even without gadgets that understand our spoken commands, research suggests that, as bizarre is it sounds under certain circumstances, people regularly ascribe human traits to everyday objects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>gadgets 小配件 小工具 bizarre 奇异的 ascribe 把…归于 human traits 人的特质 under certain circumstances 在某些情况下</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes we see things as human because we are lonely. In one experiment, people who reported feeling isolated were more likely than others to attribute consciousness to various gadget. In turn, feeling close to objects can alleviate loneliness. When college students were reminded of a time they had been exclude in a social setting, they compensated by exaggerating their number of friends — unless they were first given tasks that caused them to interact with their phone as if it had human qualities. according to the researchers the participants’ phones apparently substituted for real friends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>isolated 孤立的 alleviate 缓和 in a social setting 在社交场合中 interact with 与…相互作用 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>At other times, we personify products in an effort to understand them. One study found that three in four<br>respondents yelled at their computer. Further, the more their computer gave them problems, the more likely the<br>respondents were to report that it had its own “beliefs and desires”.</p>
<p>So how do people assign trails to an object? In part, we rely on looks. On humans wide faces are associated with<br>dominance. Similarly, people rated cars, clocks and watches with wide faces as more dominant-looking than<br>narrow-faced ones, and preferred them — especially in competitive situations. An analysis of car sales in Germany found that cars with grilles that were upturned like smiles sold best. The purchasers saw this feature — as increasing a<br>car’s friendliness.</p>

<h6 id="Why-More-Farmers-Are-Making-The-Switch-to-Grass-Fed-Meat-and-Dairy"><a href="#Why-More-Farmers-Are-Making-The-Switch-to-Grass-Fed-Meat-and-Dairy" class="headerlink" title="Why More Farmers Are Making The Switch to Grass-Fed Meat and Dairy?"></a>Why More Farmers Are Making The Switch to Grass-Fed Meat and Dairy?</h6><p>Though he didn’t come from a farming family, from a young age Tim Joseph was fascinated by the idea of living off the land. Reading magazines like The Stockman Grass Farmer and Graze, he got hooked on the idea of grass-fed agriculture. The idea that all energy and wealth comes from the sun really intrigued him. He thought the shorter the distance between the sun and the end product the higher the profit to the farmer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>intrigued 好奇的 被迷住了的</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph wanted to put this theory to the test. In 2009, he and his wife Laura launched Maple hill Creamery, an organic, all grass-fed yogurt company in northern New York. he quickly learned what the market has demonstrated: Demand for grass-fed products currently exceeds supply. Grass-fed beef is enjoying a 25-30% annual growth rate. Sales of grass-fed yogurt and kefir, on the other hand, have in the last year increased by over 38%. This is in comparison with a drop of just under 1% in the total yogurt and kefir market, according to natural and organic market research company SPINS. Joseph’s top priority became getting is hands on enough grass-fed milk to keep customers satisfied, since his own 64-cow herd wasn’t going to suffice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>demonstrate 显示  kefir 发酵乳饮品 exceed 超过 top priority 当务之急 suffice 足够 herd 畜群</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His first partnership was with Paul and Phyllis Amburgh, owners of the Dharma Lea farm in New York. The Amburghs, too, were true believers in grass-fed. In addition to supplying milk from their own 85-head herd, they began to help other farmers in the area convert from conventional to certified organic and grass-fed in order to enter the Maple Hill supply chain. Since 2010, the couple has helped 125 small dairy farms convert to grass-fed, with more than 80% of those farms coming on board during the last two years.</p>
<p>All this conversion has helped Maple hill grow 40-50% every year since it began, with no end in sight<br>Joseph has learned that a farmer has to have a certain mindset to successfully convert. But convincing open<br>minded dairy people is actually not that hard, when you look at the economics. Grass fed milk can fetch up to 2.5<br>times the price of conventional milk. Another factor is the squeeze that conventional dairy farmers have felt as the<br>price of grain they feed their cows has gone up tightening their profit margins. By replacing expensive grain feed<br>with regenerative management practices, grass-fed farmers are insulated from jumps in the price of feed. These<br>practices include grazing animals on grasses grown from the pasturelands natural seed bank, and fertilized by the<br>cows’ own fertilizer</p>
